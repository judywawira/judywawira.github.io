        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hack/fail.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Failed with gusto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Failing with gusto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I decided to try and participate in hacking open data in Indianapolis, way before I realized how tired and exhausted the Interventional Radiology week would be. I have been working on the Data Science course from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science&quot;&gt;Coursera &lt;/a&gt; with the plan that I should become a proper data scientist. I had a biostatistics class in the Informatics master’s program but the professor felt the best way to learn was to calculate all the problems only on a calculator. While that is great for PHD students in biostatistics, this left me unable to analyze big datasets on my own using statistical packages, and in turn meant I could not play in the big data game. I have R skills that I have picked up with my projects, but I thought proper training would improve my analytic skills and make me critical to data centered operations. Moreover, I have been working on registry systems to collect /aggregate data and analyze it, hence superior data skills are no longer a luxury but mission critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By yesterday evening I had moved on from the idea of participating, having left the hospital at 8 am and just exhausted. I slept in, but around 11.30 AM checked the site and with Nicole’s encouragement, I decided to try and hack on the Indiana State Auditor data. This meant i had less than 6 hours to develop
an application. See competition details &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indychamber.com/incapitolhack/&quot;&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;. The competition rules are very unfriendly, requiring giving up copyright for the applications developed, and a commitment to work on the application with no form of support for the next 9 days. Nonetheless I started to look at the available data set from the auditor office that provided all credit card transactions for the last year(2015-2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on an application based on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;R studio, R and shiny&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to develop an interactive dashboard that allows you to drill into the data and search by merchant, employee, cost paid, postal code and transaction IDs. See the hosted application here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gichoya.shinyapps.io/HackApp/&quot;&gt; https://gichoya.shinyapps.io/HackApp/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/hack/dashboard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data dashboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image showing the home page of the data dashboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the effort, my application crashed during demonstration time, and couldn’t show it off. Turns out that R did not like my use of the keyword ‘data’ and hence refused to load the dashboard after pushing code to github. My partner in crime aka Nicole did mention that my lack of emphasis on the low value of graphs to represent data while presenting to the judges was shooting myself in the foot. In my defense , I have seen multiple open data projects and visualizations are great, but in truth are hardly understood by most people. There is more value in providing resources to answer a specific question, which is what I tried to solve by allowing users to drill in and filter data that answers a specific question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, that’s how to fail a Hackathon or better yet ‘Fail with gusto’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code repo:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Global Health Radiology , Malawi June 2016</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the month of June 2016, I will spend time at Kamuzu hospital in Malawi working on global health radiology. I am getting excited for the upcoming trip despite a little twist settling on Malawi as my destination. I caught the global health bug again at the American College of Radiology (ACR) annual conference in May 2015 during the resident and fellow section and the informal evening bar when I met several staff that are teaching or reading cases from various hospitals in East Africa. I had an offer to try out a site in Uganda that fell through, but my program director Dr. Heitkamp had helped me work out a time to get a global health month. Adam, a 4th year(now neuroradiology fellow) from Emory University had suggested that I apply for the Goldberg Reeder Global Health Grant to get some money to cover at least the ticket costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to one of my former teachers and a good friend from Moi University where I attended medical school and he gladly wrote a letter of support for the grant. Three essays later, a letter from the program director my application was done and forgotten. When I received the notification that I was awarded the grant I was ecstatic. I was happy, as I knew the system in Eldoret well, was accustomed to the high altitude where the great Kenyan runners train and understood the workflow of the hospital systems and the practice of medicine. Unfortunately, Indiana University slapped Kenya with a travel ban that forbid any resident or medical student to travel to Kenya. This threw my plans into disarray, and I had to look for a new site to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to a staff working in Tanzania to check if this would be a good fit. I thereafter checked out all RADAID sites and wrote to all the coordinators to find out what work they were doing. Fortunately Melissa Culp, RADAID coordinator for Malawi reached out to me, and a phone call later I knew this would be a great fit. I contacted a resident that had been to Malawi before to hear her opinions for what would be a good low hanging fruit for me to work on. What resonated with me were the high pediatric dosages in use during CT scanning, duplicate testing given loss of results, and Dr. Mzumara (the radiologist) noted a critical need for second opinions on the ground. Malawi is a country in the south of Africa with an estimated population of 16 million people. The country has 2 radiologists with no formal radiology residency-training program. Kamuzu Central Hospital is a tertiary hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi with an estimated 600-1000 beds and serving approximately 5 million people. Realizing I needed to work on one problem, I selected an informatics program to help do the plumbing work that can help other projects be delivered on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/malawi/map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Malawi&quot; /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Map of Malawi &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been working on an open source radiology system solution to support a teleradiology system in developing countries.  Think of radiology systems as your iPhone or camera. The CT scan or Ultrasound machine is a special camera that obtains pictures from your body. These are stored in the machine and can be printed out on a film. Open source systems like DCM4Chee and Orthanc serve to provide special software to store your radiology pictures. When a radiologist looks at these images, they need to use special software to view these images like Osirix or Horos. The radiologist can then type or handwrite their report that’s then printed out to the doctor who ordered the test. The system now is that there is no organized way to store the images from the CT scan in Malawi, therefore the radiologist cannot compare the current study to the previous one. Moreover if the report is lost and the images are unavailable, the patient may receive repeat imaging, as previous information cannot be found. Therefore my primary goal is to organize the images from the CT Scan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How we are doing it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are using OpenMRS as the radiology information system that the patients name and what test was ordered. The system supports recording of allergy and simple laboratory values that help with deciding that a test is safe for a patient receiving contrast for a study. Once a study is completed, and for example we have a picture of your chest; we will save the images using Dcm4che. The radiologist can then view the images using Horos and enter the report in OpenMRS. Therefore the ordering doctors can view the report on their mobile devices, and all reports can be reprinted to avoid test repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the Buendia community, this is the hardware we want to use to run the management of images&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/malawi/edison.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Edison&quot; /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Intel Edison computer that is the size of a credit card &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a small computer (Intel Edison) with a dual-core 500 MHz Intel Atom processor, 1GB RAM, 4GB storage, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. We love it because it is very portable but powerful. It is hardy and can sit well on a truck. It runs on USB, which is helpful because of the frequent power blackouts. My idea is to create a large community for radiology informatics to create jobs for young geeks in Malawi too. Adopting the SIIM curriculum, we will launch some tutorials that interested folks can learn with and sit the exam for formal certification if they are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of my time will be spent doing radiology stuff, specifically education of the technologists and the medical students, and doing procedures like thoracocentesis , paracentesis and ultrasound biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up the online learning to support the OpenRAD project (ok I just named it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing of the current software – contact me if interested.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bit of fundraising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;say-thanks&quot;&gt;Say Thanks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank the following people / individuals helping this project become a reality
1.	ACR Goldberg Reeder grant provides $1500 for travel
2.	Nadi Kaonga who has offered a place for me to live when in Lilongwe with her grandfather
3.	Whale imaging via Laurence Heron who have offered to lend me an Ultrasound machine for the month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-we-need&quot;&gt;What we need&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More Edison boards&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;USB power banks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Procedure equipment – catheters, gel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Server space  / technical infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Computer – specifically the new thunderbolt display&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dictation software – We have tested with Nuance but are open to other possibilities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RADAID Malawi is fundraising to get more residents trained in Kenya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please reach out to me if you would like to learn more or get involved&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Year of Books 2015</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/books2015/orgs.png&quot; alt=&quot;People over profit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Figure from the book “People over Profit” to understand evolution of organization from startup &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I rekindled my interest to read books, and living 2 blocks from the library helped a huge deal. I estimated to have made savings of approximately USD 150 from book rentals , and I dived into non fiction books.  My &lt;strong&gt;top reads&lt;/strong&gt; for the year include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Americanah by  Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie&lt;/em&gt;. I loved this fiction book (only exception) as it had lots of what I would call African jokes; short phrases that I have personally been told as an older immigrant. Highly recommend it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting to Yes by Roger Fisher and William Ury&lt;/em&gt;. This book summarizes the research done at the Harvard negotiation project. Handy to tackle the people problem in negotiation, and allows you to maintain your relationships through the use of principled negotiation. Loved this book.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zero to One by Peter Thiel.&lt;/em&gt; This book is akin to common sense in the technology-hyped world, and is a good read from a geek. Highly recommend this for folks getting into the startup world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-books&quot;&gt;Other books&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zillow: the new rules of real estate by Spencer Rascoff and Stan Humphries&lt;/em&gt; – summarizes the data from the real estate site on patterns of house listing, sales and geographies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Better and faster by Jeremy Gutsche.&lt;/em&gt; I am becoming agnostic to books with a theme of get rich quick or quick wins, so this would fall in the class of self help/self motivation. My takeaway though was to be cognizant of the trends around us, handy given my increasing reliance on Google alerts as a source of news.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;People over profit by Blake Mycoskie&lt;/em&gt;. The author is the founder of TOMS shoes and he talks on the life cycle of companies. I related to this book where he describes the evolution of companies.
a.	 In the honest era, a company is focused on its business and clients (eg taking care of patients), and then the need for efficiency sets in (businesses cut costs, care about shareholders, and use technology to become efficient). In healthcare, I would say we are in efficiency phase where radiologists are pushed to read more studies irrespective of patient presentations
b.	Since there is a finite end to efficiency, these organizations enter the deceptive phase where shortcuts are used to gain more efficiency. If these businesses survive, they lose the customers, and generate lots of hate. These businesses try to get back to the honest phase through the apologetic phase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The innovator’s experiment: How Cheap Experiments Are Worth More Than Good Ideas by Michael Schrage.&lt;/em&gt; This book helps you take advantage of the fact that with Internet, the world is one huge large experiment lab, and you should get out there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Move your bus by Ron Clark.&lt;/em&gt; Curious if you can learn anything from a school bus, this book describes 5 types of people in your organization that help keep your bus moving: runners (provide support), joggers (require validation), walkers (need motivation), riders (dead weight) and drivers who steer the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fail fast or win big by Bernhard Schroeder&lt;/em&gt; is a book that challenges one to think of new ways of running business e.g. the one page business plan. It demystifies the concept of innovation being only ideas, and supports the use of business plans to innovate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The virgin way by Richard Branson&lt;/em&gt; – talks about managing people. Never miss an opportunity to take notes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low hanging fruit by Jeremy Eden and Terri Long&lt;/em&gt; talks of investment habits of Warren Buffet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Managers as mentors: Building partnerships for learning by Chip R Bell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money master the game by Tony Robbins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rework by David H&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6 day financial makeover by Robert Pagliarini&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The art of social media by Guy Kawasaki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best place to work: The Art and Science of Creating an Extraordinary Workplace by Ron Friedman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Immunity by Eula Bliss.&lt;/em&gt; Good book on vaccine myths. Listened to the audiobook and really liked it. Motivation was from the Facebook year of books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>OpenMRS WorldWide Summit 2015</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing gives me more pleasure than to write a year-end blog from the OpenMRS worldwide summit in Singapore in Dec 2015. My story of involvement in OpenMRS came from my final years as a medical student in Eldoret, Kenya. I was already tinkering around technology and wondered how the same could be used to manage HIV patients. As a matter of fate, Ben Wolfe was visiting Eldoret and conducting some OpenMRS classes every Friday evening that I participated in. I have to admit being the only girl in tough java made me persist and learn OpenMRS. This was in the year 2007. A few of my close friends, notably Dr. Rose Kosgei who was already traveling for specialized studies in the US was telling her networks about me. She is the first person that explained to me about health informatics as a specialty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openmrs.org/&quot;&gt; OpenMRS &lt;/a&gt; is an open source medical records system in existence for a decade in use in over 42 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmrs_summit/openmrs_atlas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Atlas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atlas of OpenMRS installations worldwide from atlas.openmrs.org&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My passion has been in the global health space, and truly my mission has been to figure out how to improve health care by enabling doctors with technology. Thus when an opportunity came from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shofco.org/project/johanna-justin-jinich-community-clinic&quot;&gt; Justin Jinich clinic &lt;/a&gt; in Kibera (the largest slum in Africa) to help them get started using OpenMRS for their ambulatory clinic, I was ecstatic! I met up with Peter Okoth, and instead of focusing on OpenMRS implementation; I chose to make this high school graduate conversant with the OpenMRS system for sustainability. This investment paid off for this implementation for an electronic medical records system, but I am most proud of the progress of Peter who took advantage of this opportunity and has managed the system for the last 7 years, has moved out of the slum and will be graduating with a degree in computer science. My biggest joy was to see his local village computer school that he founded to give others a similar opportunity, and this remains a big source of inspiration for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmrs_summit/peter.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Blessing during opening of the Techy World Institute of Technology founded by Peter in Western Kenya&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/RES/OpenMRS+Worldwide+Summit+2015&quot;&gt; OpenMRS worldwide summit &lt;/a&gt; was the first of the kind as a move from the previous implementers meetings last of which was held in Mozambique 2015. The summit is run in unconference style, whereby participants decide on the agenda of the meeting. I took the opportunity to talk to the members of the OpenMRS community, in a project where I am trying to document the stories of OpenMRS. OpenMRS was my way into global health, and I have remained centered and reminded of my purpose with each of the project or activity I have undertaken to try and solve global health problems in limited resource countries. Taking a historian approach, I recorded hours of stories of the people that make OpenMRS and will continue to do this over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are their faces and short stories….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;missionary-james&quot;&gt;Missionary James&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James (http://www.missionaryjames.com/) now working as a consultant for OpenMRS while he works full time as a missionary in Haiti remains a good example of the persistence of the OpenMRS community. We suffer from poor documentation like any open source project, but members like James do not believe
in forking code to set up new projects away from the master, and thus are always looking for ways to give back to the community for the greater good. Finding ways to support such members is a new focus of the community, and hopefully we will see more activities to support the OpenMRS ecosystem that makes us sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks James for showing me the camera tricks too …..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ellen-ball-and-mike-seaton-pihers&quot;&gt;Ellen Ball and Mike Seaton (PIHers)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always a pleasure to chat with Ellen and my 60 minutes with Ellen were amazing. I got to learn about her journey into OpenMRS, her work before OpenMRS on PACS in the early stages, and her view of the evolution of the community. I got to learn about how OpenMRS has advanced PIH (Partners in Health) work and vice versa, representing the symbiotic nature of the organizations that work with OpenMRS. As we walked through Little India village with Mike, we forged a plan to tackle the nightmare of reporting, and design it such that small implementers can use reporting in OpenMRS meaningfully to inform their clinical care. My hope is we can build more PIHs of the world within the OpenMRS ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmrs_summit/Ellen.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Ellen and Jordan sneak into my picture &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;joaquin&quot;&gt;Joaquin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joaquin who serves on the OpenMRS board is passionate about governance and would like to see an ecosystem of service providers helping accelerate the mission of OpenMRS that ‘information is care’. Over one of the best meals I had in Singapore, he shared his story from being a PHD student, to running his own startup using OpenMRS in Peru, to his current work to support analytics for health care in developing countries. Thinking of myself and efforts of building &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.softbrew.tech/&quot;&gt; Softbrew(TM) &lt;/a&gt; as a social company in the global health phenomena was inspiring and insightful and offered me a clarity that will shape my future involvement with OpenMRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmrs_summit/Joaquin.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Joaquin and Judy at the OpenMRS 2015 summit &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;barry-levine&quot;&gt;Barry Levine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though my interview with Barry started off with ‘ I don’t know how much I have to say / I am not sure I have all answers to your questions’, I had a lovely time hearing Barry’s stories. Probably the most resonant comment was how he referred to people that have been to Kenya. He said “If you hear of anyone who has been to Kenya and see them talk about it , they have a  dreamy look”, something that I have related to many many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;” If you hear of anyone who has been to Kenya and see them talk about it , they have a  dreamy look”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His motivation to join OpenMRS and come out of retirement was because ‘Good computing saves lives’. This was a reminder of how wonderful the work OpenMRS does is, and of the critical needs that demand our urgent attention. Barry reads newspapers and scouts the Internet for people that are just doing similar value work. And among these he
tells them of OpenMRS, and this has taken him to East Africa and Asia to implement and support multiple OpenMRS implementations. He is using a similar model to support the Kenyan youth near Nairobi to teach them engineering skills by working on solar panels. His energy and OpenMRS activism will continue to remain an inspiration to me.
 I look forward to be more involved in the projects his graduate students are working on to supplement the work we are doing for radiology on OpenMRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dr-adam-chee&quot;&gt;Dr Adam Chee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the newest community members of OpenMRS talked to me about organized informatics. He is the chair for regional HL7, HIMSS Asia and AMIA regional group. He also runs a consulting company that provides pro bono informatics services to developing countries. His experience on social entrepreneurship was very informative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmrs_summit/Adam.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alvin-marcelo&quot;&gt;Alvin Marcelo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit helped me meet up one of the most phenomenon ambassadors of OpenMRS from Philippines. Though a short encounter, It was great to hear of the work on OpenMRS in the Philippines and I look forward to chatting with Alvin over the next weeks for my 60 minutes of the OpenMRS story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmrs_summit/Alvin.jpg&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fabian-project-buendia&quot;&gt;Fabian (Project Buendia)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missed the news on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2015/03/google-builds-new-tablet-fight-ebola/&quot;&gt; Google Ebola tablet &lt;/a&gt; used to manage patients during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa? Yep that’s powered by OpenMRS. My wow moment was to see the small computing devices that are running OpenMRS on a battery. To see such innovation around hardware and delivery of the systems was mind blowing. Hopefully I will be borrowing their ideas (allowed in open source) for the radiology information system we are building on top of OpenMRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmrs_summit/edison.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;i&gt; The Edison chip (size of 2 coins) used to run the Ebola OpenMRS servers for project Buendia &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bill-lober&quot;&gt;Bill Lober&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lober,  a physician by training is a key driver behind the national EMR implementations using OpenMRS in places like Mozambique and Vietnam. His work as an academician has developed national standards for EMR evaluation and he remains a critical asset for OpenMRS. He wanted to be a part of the community from the beginning, even when he didn’t believe in the software we were building. He explained to me the model of &lt;b&gt; TRUST&lt;/b&gt; that has seen the OpenMRS community succeed over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jonathan-teich&quot;&gt;Jonathan Teich&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Teich is the clinical architect of OpenMRS, and is definitely a man to watch out for. His work on clinical decision support is in early phases. Thanks to him, OpenMRS implementers now have allergy tracking. Having resisted to join in the global health bandwagon, he finally gave in 2 years ago, and wonders why didn’t he do this earlier. Thanks for your time Teich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jan-flowers&quot;&gt;Jan Flowers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I grow up, I want to be Jan. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspiring stories of the national implementations and her work with Mozambique. Between Jan, Suranga, Jordan and I, we started to think of what it means to have diversity in OpenMRS. We had some sad statistics in terms of community and leadership diversity but I am sure we will be pushing for some change in this over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was honored when Jan asked me to work with her on the implementations and distributions of OpenMRS. To know that I am not the only one with an itch to get out there when I am not impacting the world was a pleasure Jan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mayank-and-the-harshas&quot;&gt;Mayank and the Harshas’&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from harassing Mayank to carry my laptop bag , I couldn’t help but draw in his enthusiasm. He reminded me of a younger Judy, not afraid to explore the world and enjoying technology. I have a feeling that our paths will cross very soon, and that the future is only brighter for this gentleman. Thanks for walking us through Little India and stealing the reserved table for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep up the enthusiasm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/openmrs_summit/mayank.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;i&gt; From left to right : Harsha, Willa, Maurya, Wyclif, Harsha and Mayank (OpenMRS summit participants) walking towards the Christmas show in Singapore &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hamish-fraser&quot;&gt;Hamish Fraser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having never met up with one of the founding fathers, it was an honor to hear the story on the birth of OpenMRS. I will have to write that story for a longer blog post in the New Year 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stories of OpenMRS are just but beginning. I will have more chats over the next months with various community members. Jordan has offered to edit the audio and make a podcast in the summer of 2016 on the stories I will have recorded by then.
I wish to thank OpenMRS for providing the travel grant that assisted my participation this year. Thank you for investing in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope some of these stories inspire you to make a little positive change in the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the some of the most inspiring words I heard this year from Tim Cook’s commencement speech at George Washington University in 2015&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;“The sidelines are not where you want to live your life. The world needs you in the arena. There are problems that need to be solved. Injustices that need to be ended. People that are still being persecuted, diseases still in need of cure. No matter what you do next, the world needs your energy. Your passion. Your impatience with progress. Don’t shrink from risk. And tune out those critics and cynics. History rarely yields to one person, but think, and never forget, what happens when it does. That can be you. That should be you. That must be you.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy &amp;amp; blessed new year!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a wonderful time attending the &lt;a href=&quot;http://siim.org/?page=SIIM2015&quot;&gt; SIIM 2015  &lt;/a&gt; meeting in DC between 28th 
to 30th May 2015 after a missed chance in 2014 when i was a PGY1 resident with no time off. Two weeks after attending the ACR conference, I was 
moved by the ‘dorky ‘ feeling , the upbeat mood of the attendees who were not all gloomy about the bad future of radiology , but expectant to position 
themselves for the future of radiology where informatics is core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what my friends from Babson would note as strategic thinking , I focussed on the hackathon , utilizing OpenMRS to consume FHIR images from the hackathon server 
incorporated into the patient record (this won the bes tof the hackathon for the hackathon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/siim2015/Hackathon.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some summary notes i took away from the meeting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interesting-research-areas&quot;&gt;Interesting research areas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Operator dependent factors about imaging protocols including positioning, Tech QA  etc remain a key issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;epic-and-cdss-for-radiology&quot;&gt;Epic and CDSS for radiology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epic explained how protocols will work for CDSS for radiology - The rules will be enforced at the time of order , then modified later on what was actually done .&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/acr/ACR.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first time attendee, The RFS section was a wonderful time to get to learn about ACR, and the governance structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, ACR is the advocacy body and is run pretty much close to government with local state chapters, ARRS is the classic academic type of conference
and RSNA is the industry conference to learn new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main themes of the RFS section included Imaging 3.0 (of course), Career development, Job update, business and economics of radiology and the annual debate on ‘ Is hospital employment good for radiologists’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were numerous Q &amp;amp; A sessions with the ACR leadership as well as a panel made of an academician, hospital employed radiologist and someone who started his own practice in Virginia to share on their experiences. 
Of course the highlight of this trip was the Capitol Hill visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of my main takeaways from the pretty amazing sessions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-does-imaging-30-mean-for-a-resident&quot;&gt;What does Imaging 3.0 mean for a resident?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on what can do as a resident to stay involved; here is a suggestion of things to do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build rapport with other specialties eg joining hospital committees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide referring physicians with evidence based studies — ACR appropriateness criteria&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Facilitate patient workflow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communicate effectively —Every call is a chance to brand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Know the business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interact with patients&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember radiation safety for everyday practice - Image wisely and image gently&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid unnecessary repeat examinations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrate quality in daily practice - Turn this into a QA project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Craft meaningful reports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communicate certainty and uncertainity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issue standardized actionable recommendations on incidental findings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do nothing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce delays in patient care - call referring doc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show and tell when physicians come to the reading room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;acr-101-finance-talk----steps-to-guide-you-so-you-keep-your-money&quot;&gt;ACR 101 Finance talk  - steps to guide you so you keep your money&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accept free money – Contribute to match employer contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clear credit card debt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emergency fund – usually around 3 months&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RothIRA – if you have some extra funds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maximise your  401k&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HSA if you have one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start on taxable account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pay down tax deductible debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;social-media-for-doctors&quot;&gt;Social media for doctors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of social media (and with lots of twitter use at the conference. The best take away was that 
patients will Google you , and so spending time filling some of the profiles like LinkedIn to controls the information out there 
(actually this was not from the talk). In short when patient google you , let them see your own generated content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary-of-opportunities-you-can-apply-for&quot;&gt;Summary of opportunities you can apply for&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;IF you would like to hang out at capitol Hill as you learn on advocacy , then the  Rutherford fellowship is for you. More information here&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>2015 SOIC Young Alumni Award</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday evening I was awarded the &lt;b&gt; 2015 School of Informatics Young Alumni Award &lt;/b&gt; from IUPUI.
The Young Alumni Award is given to a recent alumna (us), age 40 or under, in recognition of
outstanding early career achievement that brings acclaim and recognition to the field of informatics
and information science, and honor and distinction to Indiana University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/soic/award.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my short impromptu speech at the award ceremony&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Setup Biometric for OpenMRS/Muzima</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NAMING HISTORY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 42 tribes in Kenya , each with an interesting history of how children are named. The Luo community  for example
names children based on the season and the time when the child was born. For example ‘-chieng’ refers to ‘noon time’, and 
thus a boy born at noon would be named &lt;i&gt; Ochieng &lt;/i&gt; while a girl named &lt;i&gt;‘Achieng’&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kikuyu community on the other hand inherits names, first born children are named after paternal grandparents then maternal grandparents 
and later uncles and aunts. For example , i was named after my paternal grandmother as  &lt;i&gt; Wawira &lt;/i&gt; . Therefore i share 
a name with all other cousins named after my maternal grandmother. In modern times, most children will have an English or 
Christian name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we go through school and are required to enroll for national examinations , then we are asked for a surname and most 
students will pick a third name from their father , and occasionally from mothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus my name ‘ Judy Wawira Gichoya ‘ represents a christian/English name, my maternal grandmothers name and a surname for 
official registration for school and for documents. These names are not strictly used in this order , and vary in the context 
of introduction - As a doctor i am ‘Dr. Gichoya’, and to friends abroad i am ‘Judy’ , and in my village in Embu as ‘Wawira’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; SO WHAT? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern patient matching systems were built for organised societies that identify with a first name , middle name and last name ;
with specific national identifiers like a social security number or a universal identifier. These remain impractical for 
developing countries like Kenya where name transposition is common , names are shared hence high rates of redundancy, without 
unified national identifiers and accurate physical addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an informatician , I sought to work on improving the patient identification. Working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmrs.org/&quot;&gt;OpenMRS&lt;/a&gt; ,
an open source medical records system deployed in over 42 countries , working with the Muzima, the mobile interface for OpenMRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; ENVIRONMENT SETUP &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Requirements &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Letter to the Kenyan Patient..(from the Kenyan Doctor)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Kenyan,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking your time to read this…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 months post internship and I still suffer from insomnia. Mine is not a unique case, but one of every Kenyan doctor that has been in the system. I look back at the highlights of my long one year to remind me of how doctors and in general Kenyans must be so angry to do something about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t quite decide if it is the night I performed 2 caesarian sections with the anesthetist shining the light from his Nokia phone because the generator did not function and the operation had started, or if it is the nights that I had to beg the anesthetist to come to work for life saving operations that brings back the nostalgia. Maybe it is the worse reality of recent events of doctors performing deliveries with no gloves, of young doctors dying of renal failure because they cannot afford dialysis or renal replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish to step back from the emotional laments, to look at a typical day for a doctor. The day begins in the morning, way before 7 am to prepare for the rounds, and continues to 5 pm. In general, there are on average 3 interns in properly staffed centers and occasionally 2 interns manning a ward. This means that you get to go on call on every alternate day. On a day you are on call, the day simply does not end. On a good day you may get some minutes to have some food and get back to clear the day’s work before night time.  Beyond 5 pm, one is designated to attend to all patients through the night, with a higher burden in the surgical rotations that may require you to go to theatre though the night. The unfortunate thing is that for most of the night it is difficult to get the help of specialists in the few facilities that have them, but it is worse in areas where you cannot access the specialists. On the next morning there is no break, and you continue to work the day till 5pm in the evening to complete a 36 hour shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenyan, did you know when I can get 2 hours of sleep at night I sleep on a bench in the tea room or laundry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I applaud the medical profession in utilizing social media in communicating our plight especially on the use of twitter and facebook as a tool of advocacy. The social media has been the tool for the Kenyan public too to lash back at the medical profession, notably one from Alice. Such comments do not offend me but make me angry. For instance, does the Kenyan public know about the several instances this year when nurses were raped this year in 2 district hospitals during night duty by some ‘patients’? Does the general Kenyan public know of the humble initiatives to try and offer free service to marginalized areas organized as health camps?  I remember my first visit to Turkana as part of a health camp, and a lady with a chronic ulcer had to walk for 2 days so that she could make it to see the doctors. There are several young children with rheumatic heart disease that we took back with use to get more specialized care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the exposure to the TB cases in the wards, the medics carry a higher incidence of latent Tuberculosis, with several doctors on anti-Tuberculosis drugs. For a profession with no health cover, most of the doctors have at one point taken ARVs as part of post exposure prophylaxis and lack even basic Hepatitis B immunization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know the last time you sent relief food I had to line up for some. All shops in my area of work are closed down and my money is  worthless here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenyan, the truth is there is no good working environment for medical practitioners. The system fails to provide basic equipment and even minimum staffing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a different view, we doctors are angry at you, the Kenyan patient. You must remember that we are not God or magicians or miracle workers. When you as a patient makes several visits from one local traditional healer to another and bring your poisoned child and lie about it, I will not work a miracle. I have no access to ICU services and I have no toxicology support to work up what the poison is. When all people in your village go blind and you continue to drink illegal alcohol, if you continue to consume the same brew you will go blind by the time you arrive in the hospital. I appreciate second opinions, but when you keep paying money to a quark that treats you for a “weak heart” and you stop your antihypertensive medications, you will get a stroke, and there is nothing I can do about that. Moreover, if you are pregnant, but decide to stay at home with no antenatal care because the last pregnancy was fine, remember hypertension is a leading killer and if you come with eclampsia you have a high likelihood of dying. Kenyan, when was the last time you had a pap smear or visited a wellness clinic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point is, it is time for change. We are not perfect, we are not asking for unreasonable terms. We are human, humbled to be in a nobel profession but with family and other responsibilities. We are asking for equal rights, an overtime that you the general Kenyan get in your work, some protection regarding the higher risk of the work and environment in which we work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are asking you to be responsible for your health, and help us work better. Moreover we are asking for some piece of mind, and better health for us so that we can continue to serve you better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are sorry for the time you got less than optimal treatment in the system. I am sorry for the time I had to send you out to look for the IV cannulas for your dehydrated child to get any fluids. You may not believe this but there were none in the hospital. For the days you were frustrated because your anemic child did not get transfused, I called all hospitals and the blood bank. I obtained blood bags to allow several children to share one pint of blood because that’s all I could get. Kenyan, when was the last time you donated blood? Kenyan, I know you preferred that I rub your back through labour which I could not. I had 20 other patients in labour at that time. I know you were in pain; there are no pain medications for use in labour in our hospitals. I couldn’t rub your back, but I ran you to theatre when you had a prolapsed cord, or came in with a ruptured uterus, and saved your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenyan, please invest in your health. You do not allow my children to attend school with no unpaid fees. At the bank, I do not get free service. Yes, I use the ‘matatu’ and pay the hiked fares during the rainy season. In fact, at your place of work you clearly put up a notice saying “For credit, come tomorrow !”. I am simply extending the same courtesy to you. My services are not for free. Have you paid up for the NHIF insurance or any form of insurance?   Do you even save for health costs? Why do you make your lack of planning my emergency? The last time you came to deliver, you did not bring any clothes for the baby. This year you did not bring baby clothes again! Please respect my work area as I respect your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The frustrated Kenyan doctor…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
