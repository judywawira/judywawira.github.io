<i>Figure from the book “People over Profit” to understand evolution of organization from startup </i></p>

<p>Last year I rekindled my interest to read books, and living 2 blocks from the library helped a huge deal. I estimated to have made savings of approximately USD 150 from book rentals , and I dived into non fiction books.  My <strong>top reads</strong> for the year include</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Americanah by  Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</em>. I loved this fiction book (only exception) as it had lots of what I would call African jokes; short phrases that I have personally been told as an older immigrant. Highly recommend it.</li>
  <li><em>Getting to Yes by Roger Fisher and William Ury</em>. This book summarizes the research done at the Harvard negotiation project. Handy to tackle the people problem in negotiation, and allows you to maintain your relationships through the use of principled negotiation. Loved this book.</li>
  <li><em>Zero to One by Peter Thiel.</em> This book is akin to common sense in the technology-hyped world, and is a good read from a geek. Highly recommend this for folks getting into the startup world.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="other-books">Other books</h3>

<ol>
  <li><em>Zillow: the new rules of real estate by Spencer Rascoff and Stan Humphries</em> – summarizes the data from the real estate site on patterns of house listing, sales and geographies.</li>
  <li><em>Better and faster by Jeremy Gutsche.</em> I am becoming agnostic to books with a theme of get rich quick or quick wins, so this would fall in the class of self help/self motivation. My takeaway though was to be cognizant of the trends around us, handy given my increasing reliance on Google alerts as a source of news.</li>
  <li><em>People over profit by Blake Mycoskie</em>. The author is the founder of TOMS shoes and he talks on the life cycle of companies. I related to this book where he describes the evolution of companies.
a.	 In the honest era, a company is focused on its business and clients (eg taking care of patients), and then the need for efficiency sets in (businesses cut costs, care about shareholders, and use technology to become efficient). In healthcare, I would say we are in efficiency phase where radiologists are pushed to read more studies irrespective of patient presentations
b.	Since there is a finite end to efficiency, these organizations enter the deceptive phase where shortcuts are used to gain more efficiency. If these businesses survive, they lose the customers, and generate lots of hate. These businesses try to get back to the honest phase through the apologetic phase.</li>
  <li><em>The innovator’s experiment: How Cheap Experiments Are Worth More Than Good Ideas by Michael Schrage.</em> This book helps you take advantage of the fact that with Internet, the world is one huge large experiment lab, and you should get out there.</li>
  <li><em>Move your bus by Ron Clark.</em> Curious if you can learn anything from a school bus, this book describes 5 types of people in your organization that help keep your bus moving: runners (provide support), joggers (require validation), walkers (need motivation), riders (dead weight) and drivers who steer the organization.</li>
  <li><em>Fail fast or win big by Bernhard Schroeder</em> is a book that challenges one to think of new ways of running business e.g. the one page business plan. It demystifies the concept of innovation being only ideas, and supports the use of business plans to innovate.</li>
  <li><em>The virgin way by Richard Branson</em> – talks about managing people. Never miss an opportunity to take notes.</li>
  <li><em>Low hanging fruit by Jeremy Eden and Terri Long</em> talks of investment habits of Warren Buffet</li>
  <li><em>Managers as mentors: Building partnerships for learning by Chip R Bell</em></li>
  <li><em>Money master the game by Tony Robbins</em></li>
  <li><em>Rework by David H</em></li>
  <li><em>The 6 day financial makeover by Robert Pagliarini</em></li>
  <li><em>The art of social media by Guy Kawasaki</em></li>
  <li><em>The best place to work: The Art and Science of Creating an Extraordinary Workplace by Ron Friedman</em></li>
  <li><em>On Immunity by Eula Bliss.</em> Good book on vaccine myths. Listened to the audiobook and really liked it. Motivation was from the Facebook year of books.</li>
</ol>
