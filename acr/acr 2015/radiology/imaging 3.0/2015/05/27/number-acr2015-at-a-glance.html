<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>As a first time attendee, The RFS section was a wonderful time to get to learn about ACR, and the governance structure.</p>

<p>In summary, ACR is the advocacy body and is run pretty much close to government with local state chapters, ARRS is the classic academic type of conference
and RSNA is the industry conference to learn new technologies.</p>

<p>The main themes of the RFS section included Imaging 3.0 (of course), Career development, Job update, business and economics of radiology and the annual debate on ‘ Is hospital employment good for radiologists’.</p>

<p>There were numerous Q &amp; A sessions with the ACR leadership as well as a panel made of an academician, hospital employed radiologist and someone who started his own practice in Virginia to share on their experiences. 
Of course the highlight of this trip was the Capitol Hill visit.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of my main takeaways from the pretty amazing sessions</p>

<h4 id="what-does-imaging-30-mean-for-a-resident">What does Imaging 3.0 mean for a resident?</h4>

<p>Focusing on what can do as a resident to stay involved; here is a suggestion of things to do</p>

<ol>
  <li>Build rapport with other specialties eg joining hospital committees</li>
  <li>Provide referring physicians with evidence based studies — ACR appropriateness criteria</li>
  <li>Facilitate patient workflow</li>
  <li>Communicate effectively —Every call is a chance to brand</li>
  <li>Know the business</li>
  <li>Interact with patients</li>
  <li>Remember radiation safety for everyday practice - Image wisely and image gently</li>
  <li>Avoid unnecessary repeat examinations</li>
  <li>Integrate quality in daily practice - Turn this into a QA project</li>
  <li>Craft meaningful reports</li>
  <li>Communicate certainty and uncertainity</li>
  <li>Issue standardized actionable recommendations on incidental findings</li>
  <li>Do nothing</li>
  <li>Reduce delays in patient care - call referring doc</li>
  <li>Show and tell when physicians come to the reading room</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="acr-101-finance-talk----steps-to-guide-you-so-you-keep-your-money">ACR 101 Finance talk  - steps to guide you so you keep your money</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Accept free money – Contribute to match employer contributions</li>
  <li>Clear credit card debt</li>
  <li>Emergency fund – usually around 3 months</li>
  <li>RothIRA – if you have some extra funds</li>
  <li>Maximise your  401k</li>
  <li>HSA if you have one</li>
  <li>Start on taxable account</li>
  <li>Pay down tax deductible debt</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="social-media-for-doctors">Social media for doctors</h4>

<p>There are lots of social media (and with lots of twitter use at the conference. The best take away was that 
patients will Google you , and so spending time filling some of the profiles like LinkedIn to controls the information out there 
(actually this was not from the talk). In short when patient google you , let them see your own generated content</p>

<h4 id="summary-of-opportunities-you-can-apply-for">Summary of opportunities you can apply for</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Goldberg-Reeder Resident Travel Grant – USD 1500  provided for international travel for one month</li>
</ol>
