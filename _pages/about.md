About me
======

I am an Assistant Professor of Radiology & Imaging Sciences, [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) and a [National Institute of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/) Data Scholar â€“ Forgarty Institute / NBIB.     

My interests are in translational informatics and innovation. I study how technology is used during care provision, focusing on how machine learning algorithms fail when deployed in real life settings. I study explainability and robustness of AI and explore fairness and accountability of AI systems. My domain expertise is in design thinking, and value-based design for digital health systems.
